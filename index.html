                            With COVID-19 being a universal struggle at this very moment, the absence of credible and consistent information surrounding COVID-19 is a major source of anxiety for several people worldwide. It is important that there are tools available to keep track of its spread, both locally and abroad. 
                            This motivated us to develop an application that tracked COVID-19 statistics not because of its challenging nature, but because of its timeliness as a humanitarian issue and the opportunity to utilize varying technologies we have learned in class in such a way that would prove our choice useful as a tool to monitor the spread of the disease.
